## 2. Getting the Source Code

The best way to get project sources is to clone them from the GitHub repository. For that you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.
This is the preferred way, because updates will be easy to fetch and incorporate into your code.

Move to your project parent folder. Adapt it to your needs and environment.

``` bash
     $ cd /somewhere/on/your/computer
```

And clone the project from sources.

``` bash
     $ git clone git@github.com:https://github.com/yannick-Lapierre/lairdubois-opencutlist-Fusion360-extension.git
```

Change to the project directory:

``` bash
     $ cd lairdubois-opencutlist-fusion360-extension
```

In the future, if you want to retrieve origin sources updates, just execute the git pull command from your project directory.
Caution, because if you have changed some files, this can generate conflicts that you will need to resolve.

``` bash
     $ git pull origin master
```
